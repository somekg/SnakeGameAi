# SnakeGameAi
Implementation of a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) with Python and the Pytorch machine learning library to make an Ai play Snake Game.

It's capable of scoring a record around 60-80 after 100 games but also caps it's learning around that too, so leaving it for more games won't make it improve anymore.

Has a learning progress graph incorporated using matplotlib and the snake game is made using the pygame library.

The speed of the game can be increased or decreased by 10 using the UP and DOWN arrows or by 100 using the RIGHT or LEFT arrows.
